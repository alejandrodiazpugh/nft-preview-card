## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Just like the Order Summary Component, this was probably the second thing I tried to do when starting HTML/CSS. 
I had the file lying around myu pc for a while, never finished it. Today I decided to clean up some old projects and see how fast I could do them with just HTML and CSS. 
I think it'd be neat to try and redo it with a framework. Right now I'm mildly obsessed with Svelte, but practicing states in React should be the priority.

Within this challenge, something I think I still need to better optimize is overlays. I always seem to have a hard time getting them just right, but I think I came up with a clean solution for this particular case.


```html
    
    <div class="card">
      <div class="overlay"></div>
      <img class="img" src="./images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="">
```

```css
.overlay {
    position: absolute;
    opacity: 0;
    background-image: url(./images/icon-view.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center center;
    border-radius: 10px;
    width: var(--cardMargin);
    aspect-ratio: 1;
    background-color: var(--cyan);
    cursor: pointer;
    z-index: 1000;
    transition: 300ms
}
```
By having the aspect ratio set to 1, I avoided having to do breakpoints for when the image got smaller than the overlay, thus avoiding overlap with the hover state.

### Continued development

Overall, I think I should let these simple components down and focus on more interactivity and JS-centric challenges.
